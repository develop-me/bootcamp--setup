# Setting up Mac OS X

**Make sure you're running the latest version of macOS. If you are not then be sure to run the latest updates and restart your machine. If you do not do this some of the steps below may not work. You should *always* keep your operating system and software up to date.**

## Automatic Install

[Click here to Download the `setup.sh` file](https://cdn.rawgit.com/develop-me/setup/fe5f184c71aae72d1d06182bdf1d2aa12e346168/mac/setup.sh) and save it to your Downloads directory (e.g. `/Users/yourname/Downloads`). Next open the Terminal app and run the following:

```
bash ~/Downloads/setup.sh
```

Once the setup is complete you can delete the file. **You should also go into "Security & Privacy" in System Preferences and make sure you allow the VirtualBox kernel extension.**

## Photoshop

[Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html) is available as part of [Creative Cloud](https://creative.adobe.com/products/download/creative-cloud) subscription. The first 7 days are free, so if you wait until week 1 to install Photoshop you can get away without a subscription.

## Set up a GitHub account

You can [sign up here](https://github.com/join) (the free plan is fine).
