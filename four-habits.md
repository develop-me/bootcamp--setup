# The Four Habits of Highly Effective Coders

## Get To Know Your Text Editor

You'll spend most of your time in a text editor, so get to know it inside out

- Learn the keyboard shortcuts for all your most used functionality
- Add keyboard shortcuts if necessary

## Stay In Your Text Editor

You should try and do as much as you can from your text editor.

## Give Your Code Room to Breathe

Make sure that your code is easy to read.

- Use your text-editor in full-screen mode
- Try and keep your lines of code relatively short so that they don't wrap
- Try and keep your files short so that you don't need to scroll
- If you split your code-view, prefer rows over columns to avoid line wrapping
- Learn how to quickly swap between files so you don't need to use split view/tabs (Cmd/Ctrl+P in VS Code)

## Use the Keyboard

Every time you use the mouse your brain has to context-switch, which can slow you down.

- Learn to touch-type: a lot of people think they *can* touch type, but unconsciously look at the keyboard. Try covering your hands with a tea-towel and see if you can still write code. If not, then it might be worth doing a touch-typing course (https://www.typingclub.com).
- Learn the keyboard shortcuts for your text editor
- Learn the keyboard shortcuts for your operating system
- Don't copy and paste when retyping would be quicker
