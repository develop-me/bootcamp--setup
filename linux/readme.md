## Installing command line tools

[Click here to download the `setup.sh` file](https://cdn.rawgit.com/develop-me/setup/da39d65a65d920c274e0095a902dfdb84b48fe61/linux/setup.sh) and save it to your Downloads directory (e.g. `~/Downloads`). Next, in Terminal, run the following:

```
~/Downloads/setup.sh && source ~/.bashrc && exit
```

The tab should close itself when it's done. Once that happens you can delete the `setup.sh` file.
