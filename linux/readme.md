# Setting up Ubuntu 

If you're running a different distribution of Linux let us know and we'll panic a bit and then try and get something working.

## Download and install

- [Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) our Slack Organisation is `developme` so [developme.slack.com](https://developme.slack.com/)
- [Sublime 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1)
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## Set up a GitHub account

You can [sign up here](https://github.com/join) (the free plan is fine).

## Installing command line tools

[Click here to download the `setup.sh` file](https://cdn.rawgit.com/develop-me/setup/66955fc4c6a2993404a4d6b6e01a7d2fb9988508/linux/setup.sh) and save it to your Downloads directory (e.g. `~/Downloads`). Next, in Terminal, run the following:

```
~/Downloads/setup.sh && source ~/.bashrc && exit
```

The tab should close itself when it's done. Once that happens you can delete the `setup.sh` file.
