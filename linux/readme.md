# Setting up Ubuntu 

If you're running a different distribution of Linux, let us know and we'll panic a bit and then try and get something working.

## Download and install

- [Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) our Slack Organisation is `developme` so [developme.slack.com](https://developme.slack.com/)
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) for PSD editing
- [Sublime 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

## Set up a GitHub account

You can [sign up here](https://github.com/join) (the free plan is fine).

## Installing command line tools

[Click here to download the `setup.sh` file](https://cdn.rawgit.com/develop-me/setup/22355f3974f0d2b09125ed6aea7e7b53a64a7558/linux/setup.sh) and save it to your Downloads directory (e.g. `~/Downloads`). Next, in Terminal, run the following:

```
bash ~/Downloads/setup.sh && source ~/.bashrc && exit
```

The tab should close itself when it's done. Once that happens you can delete the `setup.sh` file.
